GAME PLAY:

1. You beat the level by manuvering your charater to the water tiles. Be careful though if a bug touches your character you lose a life and the level starts over.  You start the game with 3 lives.
2. As you progress in levels more enemies appear, but so do items your character can pick up.
3. A heart give your character an extra life and is worth 50 points.
4. Colored gems are worth points, blue is worth 10, green is worth 50, and orange is worth 150 points.
5. At higher levels boulders start to appear, these block your character's path but enemies and items can pass through.
6. When a level begins a points multiplier counts down, the faster you rack up points the more you get

that's it!  Have fun!
